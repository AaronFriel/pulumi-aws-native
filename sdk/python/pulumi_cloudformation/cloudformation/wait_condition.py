    The creation policy associated with the resource
      * `auto_scaling_creation_policy` (`dict`) - For an Auto Scaling group replacement update, specifies how many instances must
        signal success for the update to succeed.
        * `min_successful_instances_percent` (`float`) - Specifies the percentage of instances in an Auto Scaling replacement update that must
          signal success for the update to succeed. You can specify a value from 0 to 100. AWS
          CloudFormation rounds to the nearest tenth of a percent. For example, if you update five
          instances with a minimum successful percentage of 50, three instances must signal success. If
          an instance doesn't send a signal within the time specified by the Timeout property, AWS
          CloudFormation assumes that the instance wasn't created.

      * `resource_signal` (`dict`) - When AWS CloudFormation creates the associated resource, configures the number of
        required success signals and the length of time that AWS CloudFormation waits for those signals.
        * `count` (`float`) - The number of success signals AWS CloudFormation must receive before it sets the
          resource status as CREATE_COMPLETE. If the resource receives a failure signal or doesn't
          receive the specified number of signals before the timeout period expires, the resource
          creation fails and AWS CloudFormation rolls the stack back.
        * `timeout` (`str`) - The length of time that AWS CloudFormation waits for the number of signals that was
          specified in the Count property. The timeout period starts after AWS CloudFormation starts
          creating the resource, and the timeout expires no sooner than the time you specify but can
          occur shortly thereafter. The maximum time that you can specify is 12 hours.
          
          The value must be in ISO8601 duration format, in the form: "PT#H#M#S", where each # is the
          number of hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively. For best results, specify a period of
          time that gives your instances plenty of time to get up and running. A shorter timeout can
          cause a rollback.
